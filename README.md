# worded clock

This is a worded clock inspired by [qlocktwo conky] by Mowgli-writes. Unlike the original version, which updates every five minutes and uses ambiguous words to show the time, my version updates every minute and uses clear words to show the exact time. I spent a lot of effort figuring out the most optimized matrix for the letters. If you have any suggestions for a better arrangement of the letters, please message me. I hope you like it! ðŸ˜Š


1. Install conky
```
sudo apt install conky
```
2. you can use this script worded_clock.sh and add it to your startup
```
make worded_clock.sh executable (worded_clock.sh and both worded_clock1/2 must be in the same folder)
```
>Make sure you have installed font DejaVu Sans Mono, or any font that is monospace but do edit that on the configuration of worded_clock1/2 or worded_clock.ini according to your font
>
>for window user install rainmeter and use "worded_clock.ini"
>
>I made the conky script seperately, for some reason if its combined to 1 file, it glitches

if your interested in making a matrix for month
you can use this, I'm too lazy to do it now. If you have a better matrix, feel free to recommend, my brain is hurting just trying to solve it heheheh.
