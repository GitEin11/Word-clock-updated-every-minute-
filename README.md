# Worded clock

worded clock based on this https://www.deviantart.com/mowgli-writes/art/qlocktwo-conky-470067388 but instead of being updated by multiples of 5 and puzzling over the words on what the actual time is, this one that I made updates every minute

1. Install conky
```
sudo apt install conky
```
2. run this two conky script
```
conky -p 1 -c /PATH_TO_THIS_FILE/conky1 & conky -p 1 -c /PATH_TO_THIS_FILE/conky2 & exit
```
for window user install rainmeter and use "Worded clock.ini"

I made the conky script seperately, for some reason if its combined to 1 file, it glitches
