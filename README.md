# worded clock

worded clock based on this https://www.deviantart.com/mowgli-writes/art/qlocktwo-conky-470067388 but instead of being updated by multiples of 5 and puzzling over the words on what the actual time is, this one that I made updates every minute, if you have sugestion on a better arrangement of the letter just message me. I put alot of effort figuring the most optimized matrix hehe

1. Install conky
```
sudo apt install conky
```
2. you can use this script and add it to your startup
```
make run_conky.sh executable and run it. (run_conky.sh and both conky1/2 must be in the same folder)
```
>Make sure you have installed font DejaVu Sans Mono, or any font that is monospace but do edit that on the configuration of conky1/2 or worded_clock.ini according to your font
for window user install rainmeter and use "Worded clock.ini"

I made the conky script seperately, for some reason if its combined to 1 file, it glitches
